<p>
    This script is used to join a Linux server to an Active Directory (AD). It uses <strong>Whiptail</strong> to provide user-friendly input fields for the required parameters such as domain, admin group, user, and password. After entering this information, the script performs the following steps:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Installation of the necessary packages for AD integration, such as <code>realmd</code>, <code>sssd</code>, and <code>krb5-user</code>.</li>
    <li>Domain join of the Linux server using the provided credentials.</li>
    <li>Configuration of the Sudoers file to grant root privileges to the specified domain admin group on the server.</li>
    <li>Adjustment of the <code>sssd.conf</code> to control access to the server through Active Directory.</li>
</ul>
<p>
    The LDAP filter for access control is dynamically queried via <strong>Whiptail</strong>. An example of the <strong>AD Access Filter</strong> might look like this:
</p>
<pre>
(memberOf=CN=Domain-Admins,OU=Admin,OU=UserGroups,DC=domain,DC=local)
</pre>
<p>
    After successful execution of the script, the console is cleared, and a final message in a Whiptail dialog box shows the success of the installation and configuration.
