<h1>n8n Installation Script</h1>
<p>This shell script automates the installation and configuration of <strong>n8n</strong>, an extendable workflow automation tool. The script checks for required Docker settings, prompts the user for the timezone, and deploys the n8n container in a predefined Docker network.</p>

<h2>Step-by-Step Process</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Ensure <code>whiptail</code> is installed for interactive input.</li>
    <li>Prompt the user to input their preferred timezone (e.g., Europe/Berlin).</li>
    <li>Create a persistent Docker volume for n8n data.</li>
    <li>Deploy the n8n container with proper environment variables and volume mounts.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>n8n</strong> (short for “node-by-node”) is a powerful automation platform that allows users to create custom workflows connecting different apps and services — similar to Zapier or Make, but open-source and self-hosted.</p>

<p>Once the script is complete, n8n is ready to use and can be accessed via the configured Docker environment.</p>
